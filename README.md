# FÖNTS
FÖNTS is a tool for converting regular bitmap/png font files to ImageFonts in LÖVE. The code is kinda sloppy and the functionality is still rough at the moment, but it's enough to quickly turn a regular bitmap font image into one that can work with LÖVE.


**Upcoming Features:**
 - Ability to convert monospace fonts to variable-width
 - Add effects to fonts: shadows, gradients, etc.
 

**Downloads:**  
To get FÖNTS, see the [releases](https://github.com/xkaype/FontUtility/releases/).
